This application should be used in an integrated terminal from VS Code (or equivalent program). You must also be in the current working directory of the repository in order for the markdown file to located correctly. After your readme file has been created, move it into the directory of your project (up one directory). You can then remove the readme-genie repo because it has done it's job! First change directories into your project folder (out of readme-genie) then use `rm -rf readme-genie` command to remove the folder. You can make changes and additions freely.
